## Readability (25%)

### Principles
* Comments

Comments add to the legibility of the code.

* Decomposition

Functions, Objects, etc. reflect a logical separation of concerns. Wherever possible, decomposition and naming obviate the need for comments.

* DRY

Code conforms to the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle.

* Idiomatic

Follows conventions common to the language being used.

* Naming

Names for identifiers are intention revealing, i.e. they should be sensical, idiomatic, and improve code readability.

* Organization

Code is organized sensibly. Files, libraries, etc. reflect a logical structure.
