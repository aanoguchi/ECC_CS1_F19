# Next Steps

Programming for fun and following your interests might be the most important thing you can do to succeed in CS. Even programming as a hobby can be an great hobby.

## Textbooks and Academic content
### https://teachyourselfcs.com
This is an excellent no-nonsense guide. If you study from the books and videos recommended here, you'll be way ahead of the curve! (You'll notice a lot of my recommendations are in these lists) Definitely start with the "Programming" section. 
### Starting
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" and "How to Design Programs" are both excellent places to start from. 
### Problem Solving
I strongly recommend "How to Solve It" On the surface it's about math, but really it's about problem solving in exactly the way we talked about during class.

## Puzzles and programming challenges
There are a whole slew of websites which provide small manageable problems and puzzles to solve, such as:
### https://projecteuler.net
Hybrid math/programming puzzles
### https://leetcode.com
### https://www.hackerrank.com/
### https://code-golf.io/
The goal here is to write a program using as few characters as possible. This will teach you terrible programming habits, but it will force you into discovering esoteric behaviour in languages and give you a deeper understanding of the weird corner cases.

## Languages and guides
Learning new languages and paradigms can be a greate exercise to exapnd the way you think about programming. These are just some suggestions
### https://poignant.guide
why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby is an incredibly weird book that claims to be a intro to the ruby programming language, but really is more of a programming zine. Really, I'm recommending it because it exudes an enjoyment of programming for it's own sake that's infectious.
### http://learnyouahaskell.com
This was heavily inspired by why's guide, but it's much more pragmatic. Haskell can be a trip to wrap your brain around, especially coming from a C based language, but that's exactly the reason to explore it.
### https://www.pyret.org
Pyret is a language designed by the same group that wrote "How to Design Programs" It looks more like python but runs from the browser.
### Other
Languages with very different paradigms such as prolog or factor can also be eye opening.

## Lastly
Programming can be incredibly fun. It's also extremely frustrating. This combination is a powerful mix, and the best way to get hooked is to work on something you care about. Find that thing! Don't spend the break avoiding programming because you don't want to do homework. Don't do homework, Do your own thing!
