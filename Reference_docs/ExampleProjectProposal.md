## Overview
An efficient recipe manager tailored towards cakes. It will feature popular types of the traditional desert, displaying images of each. Individuals can scroll or search to discover a certain kind and view top rated recipes on how to make it. If unsatisfied with the results, the person can add their own recipe which will be stored privately in their own recipe box. However, should they be happy with a specific recipe, they too will be able to save it to their recipe box. There they can even save an image of their creatrion! The recipe box will be easy to sort and search so as to never loose a delicious recipe again.

## Background
There are few recipe managers and hardly any made especially for cakes. What you'll find is generic online subscription services and mobile/desktop applications. Many of which are outdated, cumbersome, and, more importantly, expensive.

It's time for a solution and one I feel I can provide. I've worked with the managing of information before, both locally and online. This includes the development and maintenance of websites and the organization and collection of user data. I know what it takes to deliver what the consumer wants and understand how frustrating it can be when something doesnâ€™t work.

## Significance
This project will stress the importance of databases. I will learn how to build and administer my own database while also utilizing an API to access the database of another. Beyond myself, this project aims to deliver a tool which will benefit cake-lovers everywhere; there will at last be a proper management tool for the creation of delightful cakes - a favorite desert for many.

## Deliverables
### Skeleton
  1. Running database having structure outlined by UML
  2. Terminal based application with direct access to the database
### Basic
  1. Create a parser for the handling of data between layers (database, application, and GUI)
  2. Static GUI that displays data
  3. Addition of images to generated recipes
### Solid
  1. Improved GUI which can interact with data (create, update, delete)
  2. Ability to format text of inputed recipes (bold, underline, etc.)
  3. Ability to add own image to recipes
### Awesome
  1. Data can be searched and sorted
  2. Specific views for all recipes, personal recipes, and favorite recipes
### Beyond
  1. Get recipies from an online service
  2. port to mobile platforms
  3. tags for recipies
  4. social components

## Tools
### Ruby
A natural, productive, and highly praised language.
### Sequel
One of the most simple, flexible, and powerful SQL database access toolkits for Ruby.
### Shoes
Popular and straightforward, it's designed especially for the making of graphical programs.

## Possible Problems
While I have done preliminary research on the tools I'll be using, There's the possibilty that either Sequel or Shoes doesn't have the feature set I need, and finding alternatives could prove difficult. Either of these libraries might also turn out to be complicated in ways that end up taking too much time. Ruby is well suited to writing simple parsers, but this will be the first I have written from scratch and there could be hangups I have not accounted for.
